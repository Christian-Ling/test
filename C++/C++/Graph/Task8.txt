1. The use of binomial heap improves the efficiency
compared to a binary heap by a bit. For my program it shaves off half of the time needed. and for a lot of nodes it improves it by almost 5 times

2. union find helps with improving the preformce of kruskals alforithm by 
keeping track of the connected elements and improves time needed. 

3. the timing for both is exponentially different. 
when you have small nodes you only see the time run twice as fast. but with more nodes that changes exponentially.
so the time complexity of kruskals is O(E log E) and the time complexity of prims is O(E + V log V).
