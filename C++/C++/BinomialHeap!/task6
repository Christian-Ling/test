1.binomal heaps improve merge efficiency because when merging 2 binomial heaps, its like adding 2 binary numbers which is
 O(logN) time. but binary is O(n) because it must be resturctered for a valid heaps

2.the time complexity for all is O(logN) because of the rules

3. we use binomial trees like linked lists because it makes it easier to merge trees and traaverse through it
it alows for O(logN) time as well.
